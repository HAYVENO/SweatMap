Sweatmap is a web app that helps users log their exercise sessions on the map using the geolocation API for location (or not) - the user decides.

## Features

- Log exercise sessions on the map for different activities, including running, cycling, and hiking using your geolocation.
- Show a list of logged exercise sessions with details such as distance, duration, and speed.
- Filter logged exercise sessions by activity type, distance, and duration.
- Delete logged exercise sessions.
- User authentication and authorization.

## Skills Showcased

A. Geolocation and Mapping: SweatMap uses the Geolocation API alongside the Openstreet map library to allow users to log exercise sessions on a map, showcasing my ability to work with location-based web technologies and integrate third-party APIs.

B. Local Storage: SweatMap uses local storage to save exercise data on the user's device, allowing them to access their workout history offline and providing a seamless user experience.

C. Responsive Design: I'd say I put in the most work here. SweatMap is designed to be responsive and work on a variety of devices, including desktop, mobile, and tablet. This showcases the ability to create visually appealing, responsive layouts using modern UI techniques. I part of web-dev I really love.

D. Object-Oriented Programming: Utilized OOP and classes in the development of SweatMap, showcasing skills in software design and development.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Object-oriented programming)
- Leaflet.js (for displaying the map)

How to Use SweatMap
Using SweatMap is simple and intuitive. To log an exercise session, follow these steps:

2. Choose an activity type from the dropdown menu

SweatMap provides exercise statistics, including distance, duration, elevation, depression, and speed, to help you track your progress and achieve your fitness goals. It's an adoption of Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course challenge that I had concluded, then improved, as at the time I took the course. Kudos to him!
